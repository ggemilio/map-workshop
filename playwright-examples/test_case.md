| 1. Open Home              | URL: `https://www.youtube.com/`                                               | Home feed loads; search box visible (`input#search`); at least 1 video tile present.                                                                                          |
| 2. Search                 | Type `playwright testing tutorial` → press Enter                              | Results page renders; URL contains `/results`; results list has ≥1 item.                                                                                                      |
| 3. Apply Filters          | Click **Filters** → choose `Upload date → This week` and `Type → Video`       | Results update; each visible result shows a duration badge (not Shorts/Live); published time text indicates within \~7 days (string contains "hours", "days", or "week").     |
| 4. Open Result (≥5 min)   | Click first result with duration ≥ `05:00` (use locator with text match)      | Watch page loads; player visible; title and channel link rendered.                                                                                                            |
| 5. Handle Pre-roll Ad     | Wait for ad to appear; click **Skip** if available (timeout: 30s)             | If ad appears: skip button clicked or ad completes; if no ad: continue to next step. Assert video content resumes after ad handling.                                          |

| 7. Seek Forward           | Press `→` twice                                                               | Current time increases by \~10s total (tolerance ±3s); assert delta from `video.currentTime`.                                                                                 |
| 8. Mute/Unmute            | Press `m` (mute), then `m` (unmute)                                           | Player's mute state toggles (check `aria-label` on volume button or `video.muted` via `evaluate`).                                                                            |
| 9. Handle Mid-roll Ad     | Wait for potential mid-roll ad (timeout: 10s); skip if available              | If mid-roll ad appears: skip or wait for completion; if no ad: continue. Assert video content resumes after ad handling.                                                      |
| 10. Captions (conditional) | Click **CC** button if visible/enabled                                        | If CC available: cues render (captions container becomes visible and has text). If not available: assert CC button is absent/disabled and mark step as N/A (handled in test). |
| 11. Change Quality        | Open gear (**Settings**) → **Quality** → select `720p` (or highest available) | Menu closes; brief buffering; quality label reflects chosen setting; `video.videoHeight ≥ 720` (or equals selected).                                                          |

| 16. Handle Overlay Ad     | Wait for potential overlay ad; dismiss if clickable                           | If overlay ad appears: dismiss or wait for auto-dismiss; if no overlay: continue. Assert overlay is removed and video remains accessible.                                      |
| 17. Autoplay chain        | Ensure **Autoplay** is ON; seek to last \~10s and wait for end                | After current video ends, URL/title change to a new video within a few seconds (assert navigation + new player metadata).                                                     |
